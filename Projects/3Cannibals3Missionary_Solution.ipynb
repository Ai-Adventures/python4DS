    "(Keep side of the boat in mind)\n",

    "### Step3:- ###\n",
    "Define Invalid moves and add conditional 'if' statements accordingly(Rules)\n",
    "1. Number of people in a Boat should be 1 or 2\n",
    "2. Number of chosen missionary or cannibal should not be grater than number of available missionary or cannibals on the given side.\n",
    "   In above step one should not be able subtract 2 missionary from left as only 1 is available.\n",
