    "# Learn to Code\n",
    "If you've ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you know how tedious tasks like these can be. But what if you could have your computer do them for you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll learn how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand-no prior programming experience required. Once you've mastered the basics of programming, you'll create Python programs that effortlessly perform useful and impressive feats of automation to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for text in a file or across multiple files\n",
    "- Create, update, move, and rename files and folders\n",
    "- Search the Web and download online content\n",
    "- Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size\n",
    "- Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs\n",
    "- Send reminder emails and text notifications\n",
    "- Fill out online forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-step we will walk you through each program, and practice projects at the end of each chapter challenge you to improve those programs and use your newfound skills to automate similar tasks.\n",

    "Don't spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do. Even if you've never written a line of code, you can make your computer do the grunt work. LEARN TO CODE."

    "\n",
    "Software is at the core of so many of the tools we use today: Nearly everyone uses social networks to communicate, many people have Internet-connected computers in their phones, and most office jobs involve interacting with a computer to get work done. As a result, the demand for people who can code has skyrocketed. Countless books, interactive web tutorials, and developer boot camps promise to turn ambitious beginners into software engineers with six-figure salaries.\n",
    "##### This book is not for those people. It’s for everyone else.\n",
    "On its own, this course won’t turn you into a professional software developer any more than a few guitar lessons will turn you into a rock star. But if you’re an office worker, administrator, academic, or anyone else who uses a computer for work or fun, you will learn the basics of programming so that you can automate simple tasks. \n"

    "# What Is Programming?\n",
    "Television shows and films often show programmers furiously typing cryptic streams of 1s and 0s on glowing screens, but modern programming isn’t that mysterious. Programming is simply the act of entering instructions for the computer to perform. These instructions might crunch some numbers, modify text, look up information in files, or communicate with other computers over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "All programs use basic instructions as building blocks. Here are a few of the most common ones, in English:\n",
    "\n",
    "    “Do this; then do that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    “If this condition is true, perform this action; otherwise, do that action.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    “Do this action that number of times.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    “Keep doing that until this condition is true.”\n",

    "# Programmers Don’t Need to Know Much Math\n",
    "The most common anxiety I hear about learning to program is that people think it requires a lot of math. Actually, most programming doesn’t require math beyond basic arithmetic. In fact, being good at programming isn’t that different from being good at solving Sudoku puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because Sudoku involves numbers doesn’t mean you have to be good at math to figure out the solution. The same is true of programming. Like solving a Sudoku puzzle, writing programs involves breaking down a problem into individual, detailed steps. Similarly, when debugging programs (that is, finding and fixing errors), you’ll patiently observe what the program is doing and find the cause of the bugs. And like all skills, the more you program, the better you’ll become."

    "# Programming Is a Creative Activity\n",
    "Programming is a creative task, somewhat like constructing a castle out of LEGO bricks. You start with a basic idea of what you want your castle to look like and inventory your available blocks. Then you start building. Once you’ve finished building your program, you can pretty up your code just like you would your castle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between programming and other creative activities is that when programming, you have all the raw materials you need in your computer; you don’t need to buy any additional canvas, paint, film, yarn, LEGO bricks, or electronic components. When your program is written, it can easily be shared online with the entire world. And though you’ll make mistakes when programming, the activity is still a lot of fun."
